I'm Rory Burks

I am a professional Software Engineer.  In my day job, I use C# and AWS to make Backend API Solutions, but I'll leave that for my LinkedIn.

I work on personal projects in my spare time, primarily using Kotlin.  Most of my projects are maintained for my own use, and as such most are pretty rough around the edges in terms of user experience.  My most developed project is Spirite, an art program which I use to work on some animations.  (Like many young programmers I have a game idea in my back pocket, but pursue it strictly as a hobby.)  But there are also some utility tools here and there for things like managing backups and educational purposes.

I haven't gone through the process of attatching explicit license to most of my projects, but I have no objections to use of any software posted on this github by any party for any reason and I can attatch an MIT License to any project if so requested.
